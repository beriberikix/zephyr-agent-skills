# Zephyr Agent Skills

**A comprehensive knowledge base of professional skills for building with Zephyr RTOS.**

This repository contains a curated collection of "skills"—modular packages of knowledge, code patterns, and best practices—designed to assist AI agents and human developers in building high-quality embedded systems with Zephyr.

## 📚 Skill Catalog

The master index for all skills is located within the `zephyr-index` skill:

## 🛠 Usage

### For AI Agents
*   **Discovery**: Start by reading `skills/zephyr-index/SKILL.md` to understand the available capabilities.
*   **Implementation**: When a user requests a task (e.g., "Add BLE support"), locate the corresponding skill (`connectivity-ble`) and strictly follow the patterns in its `references/` directory.
*   **Verification**: Use the code examples provided in `references/` as ground truth for syntax and API usage.

### For Human Developers
*   **Learning**: Treat each skill as a focused tutorial. The `references/` folder in each skill contains "cheat sheets" for specific topics.
*   **Best Practices**: The content emphasizes professional, production-ready patterns over simple "Hello World" examples.

## 🧩 Claude Code Plugin

This repository can be added as a plugin marketplace in Claude Code.

### Installation

1.  **Add the Marketplace**:
    ```bash
    claude plugin marketplace add beriberikix/zephyr-agent-skills
    ```
    *(Or `claude plugin marketplace add .` if working in a local clone)*

2.  **Install All Skills**:
    ```bash
    claude plugin install zephyr-skills@zephyr-agent-skills
    ```

3.  **Install Specific Skills**:
    ```bash
    claude plugin install connectivity-ble@zephyr-agent-skills
    ```

## 🤝 Contributing

Each skill is a self-contained directory with the following structure:
*   `SKILL.md`: Entry point and quick start.
*   `references/*.md`: Detailed technical guides and code snippets.
*   `scripts/` & `assets/`: Helper files (where applicable).

To add a new skill, use the `skill-creator` utility or follow the structure of existing skills.
